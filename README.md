# Theatre-Tickets-Booking-System
The Theatre class orchestrates the core functionality of the system. It facilitates ticket booking, cancellation, and management of available seats. Additionally, it provides options for displaying the seating area, saving seating information to a file, loading data from a file, and presenting ticket information. The class adopts a menu-driven approach, allowing users to select actions via numbered options.

The Ticket class encapsulates the properties and behaviors of individual tickets. It records details such as the row, seat number, price, and the person who booked the ticket. This class also includes a method to print ticket information.

Similarly, the Person class encapsulates details about individuals booking tickets, such as their name, surname, and email address.

Overall, the system enables users to interactively book and cancel tickets, view available seats, and manage ticket-related information effectively. Its modular design fosters clarity and maintainability, making it relatively easy to extend or modify functionality as needed.
